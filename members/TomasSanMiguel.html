The GCS game I'm most proud of is definitely Knight Night which was a hit on the Arcade Cabinet. I think my biggest accomplishment as President was modernizing the club by updating the bylaws and how we actually create teams.

I had the opportunity to work at Vicarious Visions in the Summer of 2018 and it was certainly the best work experience I have ever had.  I think absolutely anyone can (and should!) try their hand at making games. GCS is a pretty awesome place to give that a go!">

        <p class="game_description" style="display:none">Backside Breakout is a prison break role-playing game. Gameplay is turn based with multiple turns a day before players have to move back to their cells and lose any items not properly hidden. The most convenient place to stash items is in one's rectum, hence the title Backside Breakout. The game is won by fulfilling one of three different escape routes, possibly involving bribery, disguises, or a copious amount of spoons.  This game was created at the 2018 Pittsburgh IGDA Board Game Jam, for the theme: Freedom.</p>
