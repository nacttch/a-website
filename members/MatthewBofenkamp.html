I also taught the StuCo 'World Music: An Exploration,' while at CMU, which taught about modern popular music from literally every country in the world, and was a member of CMU's improv troupe: The No Parking Players.">

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move and jump, and press the spacebar to make a couch. If you hold down the spacebar, you can fling a couch to defeat enemies, but this costs more health.</p>
